<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
* Binance API: in order to make use of this script you need to have a [Binance](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=56142400) account. To generate your API key go under [Profile > API Management](https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management) and create one
* Discord server: to get the bot up & running on your server, admin priviliges are required. So you need to own it

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vlagh3/bitrocop.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Enter your Binance API in `config.js`
   ```js
   {
      "BinKey": "<binance key>",
      "BSecret": "<binance secret>"
   }
   ```
4. For dev purposes you'll also need your [Discord app](https://discord.com/developers/applications) clientId, token & channelId *(i.e guildId)*. See [Setting up a bot app](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot)
  ```js 
  {
    "clientId": "<id>",
    "guildId": "<channelId>", // right click channel  & Copy Id
    "token": "<botToken>"
  }
  ```
5. [Generate bot invite link](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html#bot-invite-links)
6. Start it: `node bot.js`
